# SQL Challenge

Itâ€™s been two weeks since I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

# Project structure
```
sql-challenge
|__ data/               # contains six CSV files
|   |__ departments.csv # department data
|   |__ dept_emp.csv    # joint table of employees and departments
|   |__ dept_manager.csv# joint table of departments managers
|   |__ employees.csv   # employees data
|   |__ salaries.csv    # table of employees' salaries
|   |__ titles.csv      # table of employees' titles
|
|__ ERD.png             # ERD of database
|__ table_schemata.sql  # Schemata of tables for PostgreSQL
|__ Queries.sql         # Queries made of the data
```
